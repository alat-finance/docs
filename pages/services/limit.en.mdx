## What is a Limit Order?

A Limit Order is a type of order where you can set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a particular token pair. Instead of executing the trade immediately, the order will be placed in the market and will only be executed if the price reaches the level you have set. This gives you the flexibility to enter or exit a position at your desired price point, even if the market is not currently at that level.

## How does it work?

Using our Limit Order feature is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

<Steps>
### Choose the token pair
Select the tokens you want to trade from our list of available options. You can easily search for your desired tokens using our search function.

### Set the price
Enter the price at which you want to buy or sell the tokens. Make sure to choose a realistic price that aligns with the current market conditions.

### Enter the quantity
Specify the amount of tokens you want to trade.

### Confirm and place the order
Double-check all the details of your order and click the "Place Order" button to submit it to the market.
</Steps>
## Why use Limit Orders?

Limit Orders offer several advantages for traders:

1. Precision: You have full control over the price at which your trade will be executed, ensuring you don't miss out on your desired entry or exit points.

2. Flexibility: Set your Limit Order and let the market come to you. This feature is especially useful during volatile market conditions, where prices can change rapidly.

3. Risk management: By predefining your desired price, you can effectively manage your risk and protect yourself from sudden price fluctuations.

4. Time-saving: Instead of constantly monitoring the market, you can set your Limit Order and carry on with your other activities, knowing that your order will be executed automatically when the price reaches your target.

## Advanced Trading

Limit orders additionally offer the ability to place Stop Loss and/or Take Profit, by chaining the first limit order with a secondary Bound order. By chaining a Stop Loss or Take Profit order to your initial Limit Order, you can add an extra layer of risk management and maximize your trading strategy. Here's how the advanced trading feature works:

<Steps>
### Place a Limit Order
Follow the same steps mentioned earlier to set up your initial Limit Order with the desired price and quantity.

### Enable the chained Bound Order
Enable the chained order functionality by enabling either Stop Loss, Take Profit or both.

## Set the trigger price
Determine the price levels at which you want the secondary order to be triggered.

### Confirm and place the order
Double-check all the details and click the "Place Order" button to submit your advanced trading order.
</Steps>
A Stop Loss order is designed to limit your losses in case the market moves against your position. It acts as a safety net by automatically triggering a market order to sell your tokens if the price reaches or falls below your specified trigger price. This helps you mitigate potential losses and protect your investment.

A Take Profit order allows you to secure profits by automatically selling your tokens at a predetermined price level. When the market reaches or surpasses your specified trigger price, the secondary order will be triggered, and your tokens will be sold, locking in your profits.

By combining Limit Orders with Stop Loss and Take Profit orders, you can effectively manage your risk and optimize your trading strategy. This advanced feature gives you more control over your trades and allows you to take advantage of price movements while minimizing potential losses.
