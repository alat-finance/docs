A Bound Order is a powerful tool offered by Alat.Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) app on the Binance Smart Chain. It allows you to set Take Profit and Stop Loss orders for a specific token pair. These orders act as safeguards to secure your investments and automate your trading strategy.

## How does it work?

When you set a Bound Order, you establish two price points for a token pair:

- **Take Profit Price:** This is the target price at which you want to sell the token pair to lock in profits. When the market price reaches or exceeds your Take Profit Price, the Bound Order automatically executes a sell order.
- **Stop Loss Price:** This is the price threshold at which you want to limit your losses by selling the token pair. If the market price drops and reaches or falls below your Stop Loss Price, the Bound Order triggers a sell order to protect your investment.

You have the flexibility to set both Take Profit and Stop Loss prices or activate only one side of the Bound Order based on your trading strategy and risk tolerance.

## Why use Bound Orders?

Bound Orders offer several compelling advantages for traders:

- **Risk Management:** Bound Orders help you manage risk effectively by limiting potential losses. The Stop Loss feature protects your investment from significant price drops, reducing the impact of market volatility.
- **Automation and Convenience:** By setting Bound Orders, you automate your trading strategy. This eliminates the need for constant monitoring and allows you to focus on other aspects of your life while your investments remain protected.
- **Profit Capture:** Take Profit orders enable you to capture profits when the market reaches your target price or exceeds it. This ensures that you don't miss out on favorable price movements, even if you are not actively tracking the market.
- **Simplicity and Accessibility:** Alat.Finance's user-friendly interface makes it easy for everyone, to understand and utilize Bound Orders. We believe in making DeFi accessible to all users, regardless of their background or trading experience.
-- **Ease of Mind:** Alat.Finance allows you to import and approve a token before its listing on decentralized exchanges. For that imported token, you can input the parameters of the Bound Order and pre-place it even before the listing, allowing you to limit your losses and lock in your desired profits.

By utilizing Bound Orders on Alat.Finance, you can enhance your trading strategy, mitigate risks, and maximize your potential profits on the Binance Smart Chain.
